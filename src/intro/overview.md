Slic3r is a tool which translates digital 3D models into instructions
that are understood by a 3D printer. It slices the model into horizontal
layers and generates suitable paths to fill them.

Slic3r is already bundled with the many of the most well-known host
software packages: Pronterface, Repetier-Host, ReplicatorG, and can be
used as a standalone program.

This manual will provide guidance on how to install, configure and
utilise Slic3r in order to produce excellent prints.

目标 & 理念
==================

Slic3r is an original project started in 2011 by Alessandro Ranellucci
(aka. Sound). Readability and maintainability of the code are among the 
design goals, as well as power and flexibility. Slic3r aims to be a 
professional CAM tool.

The program is under constant refinement, from Alessandro and the other
contributors to the project, with new features and bug fixes being
released on a regular basis.
